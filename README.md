# Plant Specimen Image Classification

A team of Industry Advisors with data science and AI/ML expertise will provide virtual support and guidance for student teams across all 4 program sites. These volunteers (check out the "Industry Advisors" page to meet them) will host regular virtual office hours, respond to questions via the Kaggle discussion forum, and provide feedback and support in other ways.

The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) herbarium contains more than 7.8 million plant and fungal specimens. Herbaria are a massive repository of plant diversity data. These collections not only represent a vast amount of plant diversity, but since herbarium collections include specimens dating back hundreds of years, they provide snapshots of plant diversity through time. The integrity of the plant is maintained in herbaria as a pressed, dried specimen; a specimen collected nearly two hundred years ago by Darwin looks much the same as one collected a month ago by an NYBG botanist. All specimens not only maintain their morphological features but also include collection dates and locations, and the name of the person who collected the specimen. This information, multiplied by millions of plant collections, provides the framework for understanding plant diversity on a massive scale and learning how it has changed over time.


## Description
The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) is challenging you to use your machine learning skills to develop a model capable of categorizing plant specimen images. Let’s explore what this means, why it matters, and how you’ll be contributing to an important real-world initiative that will help our planet!

OK, let's start here: Researchers at NYBG and across the world have access to millions of digitized images. These images – which include pressed and dried plant specimens – are searchable in online databases (such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ^1). They can help the researchers conduct botanical studies spanning comparative biodiversity, applied conservation, and climate modeling: studies important to the future of planet Earth.

The problem is, approximately 10% of the 40+ million database images are “non-standard.” For example, they might be images of animals instead of plants; or color illustrations of plants rather than actual pressed specimens. These non-standard images generally cannot be used as part of cutting-edge studies that aim to leverage machine learning to do things like train models to recognize new plant species, or predict and analyze biodiversity-related changes over time.
